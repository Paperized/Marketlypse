# Marketlypse
Marketlypse is a rage game made during a game jam in Unity3D. This idea behind this game is that the player is living during an apocalypse and he needs to survive 40 days so he needs to buy everything he finds inside local shops. Those item he picks increase his survival timer and will keep him alive.

NOTE: This is a simple game made in 2 days for a game jam, is not a serious project.
I made pretty much all the code except the Enemy classes (which are not used in the scene).
